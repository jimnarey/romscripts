# MAME DATs/XMLs

`download.py` downloads all available DAT/XML files from progetto snaps.

Some archives have both DAT and XML, some (approx 53 - 84, in rar format, just DAT).

BZIP  was used as it has the best compression ratio for text-based files. It's slow to compress but not much slower than other formats for decompression.

Compressed, the collection of DAT/XML files is 1.6GB. Uncompressed it's 26.8GB.
